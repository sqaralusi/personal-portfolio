        description: 'In this activity, I collected and analyzed daily step count data using the iPhone Health app for a month. While the app generally provided reliable results, I became aware of limitations, such as times I didnâ€™t have my phone with me, which could skew accuracy. Logging the data in a clean, sequential format revealed a wide range from a low of 1,006 steps (Day 13) to a high of 13,945 steps (Day 30), highlighting daily variability and helping to identify both typical and anomalous days. <p> To better understand the data, I created a scatter plot that visually revealed patterns not obvious in raw numbers. Peaks on Days 14, 29, and 30 suggested bursts of high activity, while Days 5, 13, and 27 reflected significantly lower movement. By analyzing the data, I found that activity levels fluctuated widely and were influenced by situational factors, with extreme highs and lows affecting the overall trend and average.',
